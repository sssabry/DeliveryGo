# DeliveryGo
Small program deployed locally as a part of custom local point of sale system for student startup @ Lancaster University

# Where did this come from?
The student startup's main focus was delivery orders from on campus businesses to on campus accomodation. 
Due to the varying weights, distances and combinations of such factors, they had difficulty estimating appropriate delivery fees for each order.
As a result, they reached out to me for a quick solution to act as an extension to their existing point of sale software.

# How does it work?
The algorithim allows the delivery driver to calculate the fees according to the details of each order. 
There's two versions of the solution:
- one that was deployed in the form of a website for easy, on-the-go calculation (seen in the HTML & JavaScript files included)
- one that was integreated into the existing point of sale system (actual algorithim is in Java; POS system was in C)
